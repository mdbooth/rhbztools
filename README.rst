Red Hat Bugzilla Tools
======================

Useful tools for working with Red Hat's Bugzilla instance.

Authentication
==============

Authentication is exclusively via Bugzilla API key. To generate an API key:

* Log in to bugzilla, and navigate to:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/userprefs.cgi?tab=apikey
* Enter a name for the new key in the field under *New API Key*, e.g.
  'rhbztools', and click 'Submit Changes'.

Authentication information is stored in rhbugzilla/auth in your OS-specific
user config directory. On a typical Linux system this would be
*~/.config/rhbugzilla/auth*.

The contents of the file is a json formatted dict containing 2 keys:

* login: Your bugzilla login
* api_key: A valid API key for your login

e.g.

::

  {
      "login": "user@example.com",
      "api_key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  }

bzdevelwb
=========

bzdevelwb is a tool for adding and removing keywords from a well-defined set to
the developer whiteboard of a number of bugzillas.

Keywords are defined in a keywords file. Each line of the file defines a
keyword. The first word on the line is the canonical representation of the
keyword, e.g. *ExampleKeyword*. Any subsequent words on the line are
alternative forms of the same keyword which will be automatically transformed
to the canonical version if encountered. Transformations are not case
sensitive, meaning *examplekeyword* will be rewritten as the canonical
*ExampleKeyword*.

Comments and blank lines are ignored in the keywords file.

E.g.:

::

  # Comments and blank lines are ignored

  NeedsAutomation NeedsAuto
  NeedsManualVer NeedsVer

In the above example, if *needsautomation*, *needsauto*, *NeedsAuto*, etc is
encountered in the devel whiteboard it will be automatically rewritten as
*NeedsAutomation*. Similarly, if any of the above are specified to be added or
removed from the devel whiteboard, any would be removed, or the canonical
version would be added.

bzdevelwb is invoked as:

::

  bzdevelwb [-h] [-a ADD [ADD ...]] [-r REMOVE [REMOVE ...]] -k KEYWORDS [-d]
            bzids [bzids ...]

e.g.:

::

  bzdevelwb -a needsauto -r needsver -k ~/compute-keywords.txt -- <bz1> <bz2> <bz3>

The above command will add NeedsAutomation to each of the 3 bugzillas, and
remove any variation of NeedsManualVer if encountered. Unknown keywords will be
left untouched.

bzquery
=======

bzquery is a tool for querying bugzilla using human-readable but arbitrarily
complex queries like:

::

  cf_internal_whiteboard substring "DFG:Compute" and
  bug_status in ["NEW", "ASSIGNED"] and not (
    keywords substring "Documentation" or
    component = "documentation"
  ) and flagtypes.name substring "rhos-17.0"

It returns results as a JSON list. By default it returns add fields, but
returned fields can be specified explicitly with the -f flag. It is invoked as:

::

  bzquery [-h] [-f FIELD] [-d] [-q QUERYFILE] query

Syntax
------

A basic expression takes the form:

::

  field operation value

Different operations require different value types. Value types are:

* Integers: 0
* Floating point: 0.1
* Strings: "this is a string"
* Lists: [0, "foo"]

Expressions can be joined with ``and`` (alternatively ``&``), and ``or``
(alternatively ``|``). ``and`` has higher precedence than ``or``. Expressions
can also be grouped in parentheses, which has the highest precedence. e.g.:

::

  component = "openstack-nova" & (
      bug_status = "NEW" or
      assigned_to = "mbooth@redhat.com")

Expressions and parenthesis groups can be negated by prefixing them with
``not`` (alternatively ``!``). e.g.:

::

  component = "openstack-nova" & not (
      bug_status = "NEW" or
      ! assigned_to = "mbooth@redhat.com")

Query file
----------

Queries can be read either by specifying them on the command line, or from a
query file. If a query file is used, bzquery will attempt to read queries from
a YAML formatted file, e.g.:

::

  osp17: >
      classification = "Red Hat" &
      product = "Red Hat OpenStack" &
      cf_internal_whiteboard casesubstring "DFG:Compute" &
      not (
        keywords casesubstring "Documentation" |
        component = "documentation"
      ) &
      flagtypes.name substring "rhos-17.0"
  
  osp16: >
      classification = "Red Hat" &
      product = "Red Hat OpenStack" &
      cf_internal_whiteboard casesubstring "DFG:Compute" &
      not (
        keywords casesubstring "Documentation" |
        component = "documentation"
      ) &
      flagtypes.name substring "rhos-16.0"

When specifing a query file, the `query` parameter is expected to be the name
of one of the queries in the query file, e.g.:

::

  bzquery -f queries.yaml -f summary osp17

If the given query name is not found it will instead be interpreted as a full query.
